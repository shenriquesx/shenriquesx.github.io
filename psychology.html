  	<p><strong>What is Psychology?</strong> ðŸ§ </p>
	<p>Psychology is the scientific study of behaviour and experience.  The aim of Psychology is to explore how humans <i>(and animals)</i> behave and experience the world.  There are many groups of different psychologists who hold different beliefs, referred to as <i>schools of psychology</i>.  There are <strong>six</strong> major schools of Psychology, each introduced below.</p>
	<br>
	<p>I. <strong>Structuralism</strong></p>
	<p>Structuralists believe that psychology should concern itself with the basic processes of <i>conscious experience</i>.  According to structuralists, consciousness and immediate mental experience could be considered as elements and compounds - similarly to how chemistry can describe the structure of water or air.  Based on this belief, two kinds of conscious experience are considered;</p>
	<ul>
	<li><strong>Sensations</strong> such as sight, sound, taste, smell and touch.</li>
	<li><strong>Feelings</strong> such as joy, love or fear.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The term <strong>image</strong> was also used to describe experiences that were not actually present.  For example, an experience such as listening to familiar music is considered to be composed of many sensations, feelings and images - all drawn together and crafted by the mind.</p>
	<p>Through a technique called <strong>introspection</strong>, people are asked to contemplate and report on their own mental processes as they experience an object or event.  For example; to be introspective about a book, one may describe the sensations of experiencing it in terms of shape, size, color and texture.</p><br>

	<p>III. <strong>Associationism</strong></p>
