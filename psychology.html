  	<p><strong>What is Psychology?</strong> ðŸ§ </p>
	<p>Psychology is the scientific study of behaviour and experience.  The aim of psychology is to explore how humans <i>(and animals)</i> behave and experience the world.  There are many groups of different psychologists who hold different beliefs, referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_psychological_schools"><strong>schools of psychology</strong></a>.  There are <strong>six</strong> major schools of Psychology, each introduced below.</p>
	<br>
	<p>I. <strong>Structuralism</strong></p>
	<p>Structuralists believe that psychology should concern itself with the basic processes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness"><strong>conscious experience</strong></a>.  According to structuralists, consciousness and immediate mental experience could be considered as elements and compounds - similarly to how chemistry can describe the structure of water or air.  Based on this belief, two kinds of conscious experience are considered;</p>
	<ul>
	<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensation"><strong>Sensations</strong></a> such as sight, sound, taste, smell and touch.</li>
	<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeling"><strong>Feelings</strong></a> such as joy, love or fear.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_image"><strong>image</strong></a> was also used to describe experiences that were not actually present.  For example, an experience such as listening to familiar music is considered to be composed of many sensations, feelings and images - all drawn together and crafted by the mind.</p>
	<p>Through a technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introspection"><strong>introspection</strong></a>, people are asked to contemplate and report on their own mental processes as they experience an object or event.  For example; to be introspective about a book, one may describe the sensations of experiencing it in terms of shape, size, color and texture.</p><br>	

	<p>II. <strong>Functionalism</strong></p>
	<p>Functionalists are concerned with the purposes <i>(functions)</i> of mental processes.  This school of psychology is largely influenced by biology.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin"><strong>Charles Darwin</strong></a> developed a revolutionary theory of evolution that provided an account of how living organisms change and develop over time through the process of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection"><strong>natural selection</strong></a>.  Living organisms have characteristics such as strength, speed and temperament - which are variable <i>within</i> the same species.</p>
	<p>According to Darwin, organisms whose characteristics best suited their environment survived and reproduced, while those with less adaptable characteristics died out.  Those who survived would transmit their characteristics to the next generation, enabling them to survive.  As a result, a given species would evolve over several generations.</p>
	<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_James"><strong>William James</strong></a> was heavily influenced by Darwin and theorized that the function of consciousness was to enable humans to behave in ways that would aid survival through adaptation to their environment.  When adaptive behaviours are repeated frequently, they become habit.  James believed that habits led to stability and predictability within society.</p>

<br>

<p>III. <strong>Associationism</strong></p>
	<p>Associationists are concerned with the idea that learning leads to the formation of associations.  As a result, this school of psychology is mostly associated with research into memory.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Ebbinghaus"><strong>Hermann Ebbinghaus</strong></a> developed a nonsensical syllabus with no meaning in order to study it as 'new' learning material - all while investigating the learning process.  His process of studying this new learning material was regarded as the process of formation new associations - as the materials had no association with previous learnings.  Ebbinghaus' findings provided much insight into memory <i>(remembering and forgetting)</i> that still holds today.  For example, his work suggested that material is forgotten quickly after learning, but continuous study reduces the rate of forgetting.</p>
	<p>A physiologist named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Pavlov"><strong>Ivan Pavlov</strong></a> made significant contribution to the study of learning through experiments with animals.  He discovered a pattern in dogs whereby food <i>(an 'unconditional stimulus')</i> can be linked with salivation <i>(an 'unconditional response')</i>.  When a dog is continuously offered food at the same time as a buzzer, an association between each is formed.  Eventually, a buzzer can be sounded <i>(without the presence of food)</i> and will provoke salivation from the dog.  This process became known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning"><strong>classical conditioning</strong></a>.  The principles of classical conditioning have been used to explain the development of irrational fears or phobias. </p>
