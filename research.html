  	<p><strong>The Experimental Hypothesis</strong></p>
	<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis"><strong>hypothesis</strong></a> is a proposed prediction that needs to be tested.  The aim of an experiment is to test whether the hypothesis is supported by the behavior of people.</p>
	<p class="example">Drinking one cup of coffee per day (as opposed to zero cups) will increase self-reported anxiety in college students.</p>

	<p><strong>The Null Hypothesis</strong></p>
	<p>In order to conduct a valid experiment, it must be possible for the predicted effects to occur <i>or</i> not to occur.  The hypothesis must always be tested against a <strong>null hypothesis</strong>, stating that the expected results will not occur.</p>
	<p class="example">Drinking one cup of coffee per day (as opposed to zero cups) will <strong>not</strong> increase self-reported anxiety in college students.</p>

	<p><strong>Variables</strong></p>
	<p>The variable manipulated by the researcher is known as the <strong>independent variable</strong>.  The second variable, representing the participant's scores, is known as the <strong>dependent variable</strong>.  This is because the scores are dependent on how the researcher manipulates the independent variable.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p class="example">The <strong>independent variable</strong> is whether the participant has consumed <u>one</u> or <u>zero</u> cups of coffee.</p></li>
		<li class="move-up"><p class="example">The <strong>dependent variable</strong> is the participant's self-reported anxiety on a 10-point scale.</p></li>
	</ul>
	<p>A basic experimental design is to allocate people to <strong>experimental conditions</strong> representing different conditions for the independent variable.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p class="example">Condition A - Consumed <u>one</u> cup of coffee.</p></li>
		<li class="move-up"><p class="example">Condition B - Consumed <u>zero</u> cups of coffee.</p></li>
	</ul>
